## Project Modules

The project is modularized into the following components:

1. **Management of Routes**: This module handles all aspects related to the management of bus routes. It includes the creation, modification, and deletion of routes. Details such as route numbers, number of stops, fare stages, and running times are managed here.

2. **Trip Details**: This module stores and manages information related to each bus trip. Each trip is identified by a unique trip number, and this information is crucial for ticketing and passenger management.

3. **Bus Details**: This module keeps track of all the details regarding the buses, such as bus type, depot, fare increments, bus numbers, and passenger types (e.g., child or adult). It ensures all bus-related information is up-to-date and accessible.

4. **Bus Ticketing**: The ticketing module integrates information from all other modules to provide a seamless ticket booking experience for users. It calculates fares based on route numbers, bus types, stops, and passenger types. It also manages ticket generation and printing.
